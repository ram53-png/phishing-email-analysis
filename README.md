# phishing-email-analysis
## Overview
This project contains the analysis of a phishing email as part of my internship task.  
I examined a suspicious email to identify phishing characteristics and created a report.

## What I Did
- Reviewed the sender's address for signs of spoofing
- Checked the email header for suspicious source information
- Identified misleading links and suspicious URLs
- Looked for urgent language and threats in the message
- Spotted spelling and grammar errors
- Summarized all phishing indicators into a report
- Created a simple presentation file for easy viewing
- Uploaded the report and other materials to this GitHub repo
